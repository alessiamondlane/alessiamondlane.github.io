	<p>This May I graduated from Northeastern University <strong>GO HUSKIES</strong> with a BS in Human Services. After five fantastic years of college...mixed in with:</p>
<ul>
	<li> 3 Co-op jobs </li>
	<li> 1 Internship </li>
	<li> One 6-week Study Abroad to Bali, Indonesia </li>
	
	<p>Unsure of where exactly I wanted to begin my professional career I decided to do a little soul-searching, sunshine, and an INBOUND 2013 conference would bring me to Startup Institute. </p>
