				<p><b>About Me</b></p>
				
				<p>I come from a background in Human Services and I like to bring my energy and passion for social good to the table. I lived in three different continents, which simply means I love meeting new people because I always had to learn to adapt to my new environments.</p>

				<p>I have had the great opportunity to work in various corners of the Human Services field, from investigating civil rights complaints, to working for a small nonprofit, to researching accessible digital platforms for students in the classroom. I am an advocate and a storyteller.</p>

				<p><b>Where do you draw your inspiration from?</b></p>

				<p>A few years ago I saw an incredible talk from RSA Animate by Sir Ken Robinson, it was called ‘Changing Education Paradigms’. I remember watching in awe and nodding my head to both the topic of discussion and to the engaging animation.</p>

			<div class="article column2">
				<p>To this day I still like to direct other education-enthusiasts to this video. It was a talk that struck me to be creative and captivating as an special education advocate.</p>			
			</div>

			<div class="article column3">
				<p>I wanted to get involved and I wanted to have a voice in the discussion. This video, coupled with my experience interning at the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST), showed me another mechanism for telling my own story.</p>
